# Projet_SGBD_DITI1

Simple interface that manages hotel and show reservations made using the django framework and mysql server. All back-end process happens locally.

## The django project is named 'mysql' and we have created one single app into it named 'test_app'.

## All dependencies of our virtualenv is stored in requirement.txt file and can be accessed by the following command
    pip3 install -r ~/mysql_projet/mysql/requirement.txt
After the installation of all package run the django server with: python3 ~/manage.py runserver and check the app layout and test the functionnality. It's yours now 😁️ !
